Search

Javascript functions to create a search box that would be appropriate for the website
From Field to Plate.  The website's posts are primarily recipes for wild game.  I want
to create a search for those recipes that makes it very easy to find appropriate recipes.

I want to be able to filter the list in different ways including:
    1. type of recipe; lunch, snack, dinner, etc.
    2. primary game meat used
    3. type of cuisine
    4. major ingredients

    and any others that I think of while working on the project.

I want to include checkboxes that can limit the search.
I want examples of similar recipes to be shown.


I want to bring users to the point of purchasing a cookbook.
